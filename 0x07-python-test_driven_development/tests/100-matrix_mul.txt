This is the Start of Unit Testing...

TESTING WITH the following...

Does the same as test below, but gives more details
# python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/100-matrix_mul.txt
# python3 -m doctest -v ./100-matrix_mul.txt | tail -2

Importing TEMPLATE function
>>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul

SUCCESS CASES

Category 1

Test 1: 2x2 matrix multiplication
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
[[7, 10], [15, 22]]

Test 2: 1x2 matrix multiplication with 2x2 matrix
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]])
[[13, 16]]

Test 3: 1x2 matrix multiplication with 2x1 matrix
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3], [4]])
[[11]]

Category 2

Test 4: Mismatched dimensions (2x2 and 3x3)
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

Test 5: Empty matrix m_a
>>> matrix_mul([], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be empty

Test 6: Empty matrix m_b
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be empty

Test 7: Non-integer/float elements in m_a
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, '4']], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: m_a and m_b should be lists of lists containing only integers or floats and each row should have the same size

Test 8: Non-integer/float elements in m_b
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [['1', 2], [3, 4]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: m_a and m_b should be lists of lists containing only integers or floats and each row should have the same size

Test 9: Non-list input for m_a
>>> matrix_mul(123, [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: m_a and m_b should be lists of lists containing only integers or floats and each row should have the same size

Test 10: Non-list input for m_b
>>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], '123')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: m_a and m_b should be lists of lists containing only integers or floats and each row should have the same size

Test 11: Missing input for m_a
>>> matrix_mul()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'm_a' and 'm_b'
